java tasks &amp; their solutions (maybe)

## Tasks, which are realised: 
 1. Binary Search
 2. Expression Parser
 3. Markdown to HTML converter
 4. Rubic's cube (special) 
## Tasks, which should be realised:
 1. Array Queue 
 2. Something another in the _future_...

Right now that's all.

Some _funny_ `code`? __No__. Actually yes, but __no__.
